                    <h2> Nike/Jordan </h2>
                    <p> Nike signed basketball superstar Micheal Jordan on October 26,1984, to create a sub-divion of
                        Nike named after Jordan
                        himself.The first
                        shoe they came out, the Jordan 1 high, was heavily inspired by the Nike Air Ship Which Jordan
                        would be seen playing in often.
                        after the relase of the second shoe in the line, the Jordan 2, Jordan threatend to leave Nike
                        for a deal with Adidas in 1988.
                        Tinker Hatenfield saved Nike's relationship with jordan with the design of the Jordan 3 which
                        won over
                        Jordan and continued the brand for another 30 years.

                <h2>Did you know that ... </h2>
                <p> MCSHF has been sued a total of two times over it's shoes the Wavy Baby in colaboration with rapper
                    Tyga and the Satan Shoe in colaboration with
                    rapper Lil Nas X. The Wavy Baby being inspired by vans' classic Old Skool low cut sneaker with a
                    twist, litteraly, the shoe has a "Wavy" or worped effect both
                    on the upper and outsole, making them a liability when walking in them, MCSHF discloses gives a
                    warning to the buyer that they
                    wont be responsible for anything that happends to you as long as your foot is in the shoe. However
                    the
                    falling hazard isn't the reason they were sued, It was because the shoe heavily resembled Vans' Old
                    Skool model. The law suit ended with </p>
                MCSHF being ordered by a federal judge to stop all production and distribution of the Wavy Baby.
                <p>The Satan Shoe law suit started in a similar way,instead being inspired by
                    another shoe MCSHF customized an already existing shoe,the Nike Air max 97s.
                    There were only 666 pairs produced and sold at a wopping $1,018. Nike sued
                    because they didnt want
                    to be associated with MSCHF or the satan shoes in anyway. Not to mention that each shoe had a drop
                    of blood injected into
                    the air bubble unit. Nike settled with MCSHF to accept all returns of the Satan Shoes and give a
                    full refund.However, if
                    customers chose not to return the shoes and had complants or health issues as a result of the shoes
                    they would have to contact
                    MCSHF over the problem and not Nike.</p>
